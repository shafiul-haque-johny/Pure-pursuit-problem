# Pure-pursuit-problem

A fighter aircraft sights an enemy bomber and flies directly toward it, in order to catch up and destroy it. We have to determine whether the fighter aircraft can catch/destroy the enemy bomber or not within a given time.

Task-1 :
Input - 1:
Position of A (0,0)
Position of B(10,000, 10,000)
Va = 60 m/s
Da(attack distance) : 1000m
Time limit : 300sec.
deltaT = 2sec
Vb = 50 m/s(x-coordinate changes only)


Input - 2:
Position of A (10,20)
Position of B(10,000, 5000)
Va = 50 m/s
Da(attack distance) : 1500m
Time limit : 600sec.
deltaT = 2sec
Vb = 50 m/s(x-coordinate changes only)

Output: defense A attacked enemy B with distance 10m. or, defense A didn’t attack enemy B.


Task-2:
Input -1 :
Position of A (0,1000)
Position of B (12000,2000)
Position of C (10000,10000)
Position of D (5000,15000)
Va = 60 m/s
Vb = 60 m/s
Vc = 60 m/s
Vd = 60 m/s(x-coordinate changes only)
Da(attack distance) : 1000m
Time limit : 300sec.
deltaT = 2sec


Ouput: A attacked B with position 10m . Or, No attack occurred….
